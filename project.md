I would like for you to create me the world's best Congressional Debate Flowing web app.

The app should have a very simple, ultramodern, $1,000,000 UI that is easy to navigate.

It should have the following features:

- It should be formatted like an aff/neg table. I should be able to add speakers to both sides and simply write down their arguments (the act of flowing).

- i should be able to label when a speaker has presented a refutation to another speaker, and when i hover over that speaker's argument, it should show a line pointing from all the speakers that they've refuted, and a line towards all the speakers that have refuted them

- the app should be able to provide a summary of the major arguments and areas of clash in the round, and provide recommendations on what arguments still remain to be settled and which areas of the debate are still muddled and contentious
